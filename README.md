# Data support

(1) Microsoft Academic Search data of the top 100 researchers based on the h-index ranking. In this study, two research fields are considered: Library Science, and Management Science (see https://academic.microsoft.com/authors).

(2) Microsoft Academic Search data of the “AI’s 10 to Watch” list of the 10 prominent young researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is updated every two years by the IEEE Intelligent Systems. Specially, this study uses the “AI’s 10 to Watch” data corresponding to 2011 and 2013 (Wang, 2011; Zeng, 2013)

(3) The data set provided in van Bevern et al. (2016), which consists of the Google Scholar data of 22 researchers listed in the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization in 2013 (IJCAI’13), and the Google Scholar data of 30 researchers randomly selected from the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence Organization in 2018 (IJCAI’18) (see https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/).
